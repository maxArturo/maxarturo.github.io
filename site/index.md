This is the personal website of one Max Alcal√°. You may find posts related to technology, software development and other things I find of interest. 

I am currently looking for remote contractor roles. If you wish to reach out to me, please send me an [email](mailto:cf9o2mcux@mozmail.com) and tell me something about sourdough bread. It is both a non-trivial bot test and a great way to start a conversation.
