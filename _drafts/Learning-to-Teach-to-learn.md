title: Learning to Teach
---

Everyone has frustrating moments with their significant other at some point in time. If you were to ask my wife, she'd tell you immediately that I don't explain things properly. In her mind, things must be processed perfectly and without any loss of context, meaning or precision â€“ and perfectly formed for her mental consumption. Although thats *her* viewpoint, I actually think I explain things rather well (ahem).

Regardless, we've been able to have very meaningful conversations ever since we met. And now that she is learning programming and non-trivial CS concepts, I am very happy to be available to her and help with any questions she has.

It's something that I've discovered as of recently - throughout my time learning about programming and learning about learning to program (emphasis placed), I get a lot of pleasure from helping others and giving them the tools to internalize knowledge. I've started going to more meetups and find myself talking to a lot of people who are just starting out, and this gives me a chance to improve my communication and knowledge-sharing skills. What I've found more surprising is the sheer variet of the people that show up willing to put the time, effort (and many times money) into learning the craft. A number of them are very honest and fully subscribe to what [Mr. Januska](http://antjanus.com/blog/thoughts-and-opinions/im-a-developer-but-its-not-my-passion/) mentioned in his provoking post recently. Namely, that they don't neccesarily have a *burning* passion to learn to program, but that the industry is very rewarding towards those who are able to `code` and that they are willing to retool themselves to be a part of this economic boom. I do warn these folks that you will have a [bad time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5j5iz2eA)
