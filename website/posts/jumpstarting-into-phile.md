Back in the day (slowly I feel more attributed to use that phrase), I messed with PHP and MySQL to produce a passable webpage, but alas â€“ with the passage of time, the domain along with the content has been claimed by Oblivion. It seems that everyone is running amock these days with node.js and Django - where was my own shiny webpage?

## Enter [Phile](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile)

<!-- more -->
 It is a flat CMS - that means there is no database behind it (though I think there is a sqlite DB hidden somewhere, but I shall dive deeper). It uses a clever layout of PHP that enables you to create `.md` files and have them appear as content in your webpage. That's it - no messy uploading or indexing. You wouldn't even need a navigation page if you wanted, as the files are linked into your page automagically.

Phile is forked off of Pico CMS, the daddy behind the concept - but it seems to have enough quirks for people to move into an OO layout of the functions and resources and I must say, it is a pleasure to use.

Take me, for instance - I am mainly a VBscript guy in my day to day affairs. I am usually time-constrained so I like to be very careful what project I jump into. Knowing that I wanted to kick a site into life, I was about to go with one of the mainstream CMS's (cough, *django*), yet the flat-file philosophy really captured me. I used to be one of those guys in college that exclusively browsed the web with [eLinks](http://elinks.or.cz/) and thoroughly enjoyed XFCE on a 486, so that would fall in line.

Within minutes (and within days of finding a quaint little hosting service that had `mod_rewrite` activated) I was up and running. It gently exposed me to Twig and rekindled the PHP interest in me, just so I can contribute back. Feel free to check out the GitHub repo, the [summary of features](http://philecms.github.io/Phile/) and also James Doyle's shindig. He seems like a smart man.

##### EDITORS NOTE

You may see that this webpage is actually hosted in [Octopress](https://octopress.org), a Jekyll blogging implementation with lots of handy settings in SASS and yml configurations that I recommend you check out.

In the effort of looking for the most 'static' CMS system (if you can name Octopress one, it's more of an advanced HTML/CSS/JS rolling engine) I was won over by its advanced configuration settings and an introduction to Ruby at the same time. I still fully recomend Phile and encourage you to help James out if PHP is close to heart.

If you are reading this currently, it means that the original post is very, very outdated. There is link rot and some of the projects limp on, spirited forward by either Github pages (which has a death grip on Jekyll for some reason) or they have frozen in time. 

You could also argue that I've frozen in time, except in these *deus-ex-machina* apparitions where I pontificate from a metaphorical floating cloud at my self ten years prior. Nonetheless, I try to keep these fourth-wall incusrions slim and practial, or as much as my rambling style allows. 

For the latest iteration of my website generator machinery [look here](TODO). Otherwise please keep perusing.

Namaste.
