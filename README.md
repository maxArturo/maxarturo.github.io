# Max Arturo's Blog and Various Thoughts

My personal blog took a couple of revisions and ultimately collapsed whenever I yanked the cord from DreamHost. I had wanted a more minimalist inspiration - Octopress had proved itself useful, but the customization took a toll (and rather irked me). Hence, here we are starting fresh. I will do my very best to reintegrate all my previous posts. Any kind of revival of posts (and written text, for that matter) begs for the proof of inherent worth of the text - something I'd rather not think of at the moment. 

Cheers! 

## Development
You're honestly better off forking [Poole](http://demo.getpoole.com) itself. It's pretty awesome.
However, if you find something that drives you mad enough to reach out to me, raise a pull request/issue. Surprise me!
