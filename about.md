I like to thing that all creative endeavors benefit from mutual interaction within one's mind. With that effort (and to keep a general appearance of still being alive to the web community) I strive to write my own guided thoughts.

Developing a cohesive narrative out of the never-ending stream of consciousness in our minds is a true burden, a skill that few are born into and most have to strain to harness. In modern type-writing times, every triumphant paragraph written is celebrated with a [carriage return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return) and a [line feed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/line_feed) - nowadays less pompously represented by the enter key. This blog's name captures that act in hopes of repeating it as many times as possible and share my inner thoughts with the world at large.

Herein you will find some thoughts of mine that I find worth writing (which thankfully shares a minimal cross-section with the full set of my thoughts). Musings on recent reads, Ruby code, and the generic cacophony of current events shall be guests to this humble virtual slate of mine. I hope you find meaningul and thought-provoking content here.

Carriage return, line feed.


## Development
This site is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/maxArturo/maxarturo.github.io), and is built using [Poole](http://demo.getpoole.com) as a starting point for the prebaked blog. It is based off of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It's pretty awesome.

However, if you find something that drives you mad enough to reach out to me, raise a pull request/issue. Surprise me!
