Nunca termino de saber por qué hago ciertas cosas".</em> </p><p>  Ernesto Sábato, <em>El Túnel</em> </p></blockquote><p>Today has marked a passing of seasons for me. I have just removed the DNS records of the <code>maxarturoas.com</code> domain, and relinquished its registrar ownership. Its expiration had been approaching soon and I loathed the renewal process. Of course, I loathe most renewal processes. But I think this one was worse - it's like an unused gym membership, brimming with unspent potential. </p><p>Maybe it's the bright May-weather, but something spurred me into action. I finally dusted the blog and sought a suitable domain consisting of my first and first last names, respectively. Hopefully this is where you're reading this post. </p><p>Having to come back and face this piece of derelict web real estate forces one to reconsider, to think about the past. It's the virtual equivalent of cracking open a previously-forgotten box of mementos: part nostalgia, part shame, full parts too-clear remembrance. It has (thankfully) forced me to review my now-stagnant blog and try to give it a good thought as to where I'd like to take it, going forward. For anyone who has been waiting, my apologies. Here's to a start. </p>
