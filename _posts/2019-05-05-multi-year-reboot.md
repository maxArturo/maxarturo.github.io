Today has marked a passing of seasons for me. I have just removed the DNS records of the `maxarturoas.com` domain, and relenquished its registrar ownership. Its expiration had been approaching soon and I loathed the renewal process. Of course, I loathe most renewal processes. But I think this one was worse - it's like an unused gym membership, brimming with unspent potential. 

Maybe it's the bright May-weather, but something spurred me into action. I finally dusted the blog and sought a  suitable domain consisting of my first and first last names, respectively. Hopefully this is where you're reading this post.

Having to come back and face this piece of derelict web real estate forces one to reconsider, to think about the past. It's the virtual equivalent of cracking open a previously-forgotten box of mementos: part nostalgia, part shame, full parts too-clear remembrance. It has (thankfully) forced me to review my now-stagnant blog and try to give it a good thought as to where I'd like to take it, going forward. For anyone who has been waiting, my apologies. Here's to a start.
